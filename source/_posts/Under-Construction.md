It's kind of an old internet in joke... if you were around the web in the late '90s, you might remember the old "under construction" gifs proliferating geocities pages back in the day. Well yes, this is my project. And, it's under construction. I'm hacking it together on Christmas 2018.

This year I've had a wild year. I'm glad it's coming to a close, and that my next chapter is starting in earnest. The quick version: My Dad died at the beginning of the year, at the middle of the year I sold my company, and now we're having family Christmas and really enjoying it.

Goals for the next chapter:

I really want to help as many people as I can. That's both through my new work at Facebook on Vidpresso, and through potentially advising startups. I also want to learn / help out the peer-to-peer web community. I'm not sure I'm the right person to build a product that spreads virally, and what have you, but I do share a lot of common beliefs with that community, and want to continue to work closely with them.

I hope to port this site to dat protocol sometime soon, within the next few months. I also want to get into public writing more. About VC / startups, about video, and about generally things I think I understand now. I finally have something unique to say, and when I was blogging previously, if you can find those shards of my past online, I said a lot, but very little of it was meaningful.

More tk. Soon I hope.
